Minimal APIs are a clean and straightforward way to build small microservices and HTTP APIs in ASP.NET Core. No complicated scaffolding, no unnecessary dependencies. Minimal APIs hook into ASP.NET Coreâ€™s hosting and routing capabilities and allow you to create fully functioning APIs with just a few lines of code.
This project is built on ASP.NET CORE 7.0
